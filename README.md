#Problem description

In this project, we consider a network with one central donation receiver that receives stochastic
supply/donations before serving uncertain demands at a demand node. The aim would be to
allocate a portion of the supply to each demand node so that fairness in distribution is maintained
among all possible supply and demand scenarios. First, we present a small instance with one food
bank and five counties that have to be served with available supplies. Later, we present a numerical
illustration using real data to allocate supplies from the hub to 10 agencies in Raleigh city with aggregated demands.
